Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

(Github Wiki pages don't seem to support syntax highlighting, so the above won't be colourful (the strings are not red, for example). Try it out in a *Markdown Here* email or a Github Markdown README or Github Issue -- you can preview a new Issue without submitting it.)

Again, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

The Pythagoras Theorem: $a^2+b^2=c^2$

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\mathrm{e}^{a(x)} = a'(x)\mathrm{e}^{a(x)}
$$

$$
\iiint_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{\Phi} \,\mathrm{d}V = \oint_S \mathbf{\Phi}\cdot\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{S}
